4. Export everything into 1 folder

## Rename Images 
1. Select images inside the folder and rename them in bunches using window's utility
2. Copy names from the measurements doc

## Write Descriptions 
1. Take Product Names and assign them each row in Excel, add a header for [Full Name]
2. Insert the front facing image of each image into Excel next to name 
3. Create the following columns:

4. Use GPT_Vision to write an [GPT Image Description] using GPT_Vision 

### Use GPT_Vision for tags and care instructions
Extract the following details from the tag in this image:

Composition: List the materials and percentages (e.g., 100% Cotton, 80% Wool, 20% Nylon). If no composition is listed, return n/a
Care Instructions: Summarize the care instructions (e.g., Hand wash cold, Do not tumble dry). If no care instructions are visible, return n/a

### Use GPT to write final description using this convention:
[Full Name]

<History or Interesting Notes>
[Notes/History] - Insert 2-3 sentences highlighting the item's history, significance, or uniqueness. Focus on why it's important or special. Use storytelling here to make it engaging.

<Product Description>
[Designer], [Marked Size], [Color], [Condition], [Primary Material], [Fit], [Closure Details], [Design Details], [Construction Details], [Season or Year of Production], [GPT Image Description] - Provide 2-5 factual sentences describing the item. Avoid adjectives unless strictly necessary for clarity. If any variables are missing or empty, please skip them.

<Condition>
Condition Rating: [Condition Rating/10]  
[Damage] - Mention any specific flaws in the item as a sentence or two. Be honest and reflective of the item's quality. If there are no flaws, simply state "No visible flaws."

<Item Details>
Marked Size: [Marked Size] or "Unmarked" if unknown  
Composition: [Composition Tag] or "Unknown" if the tag is missing or damaged  
Origin: [Country of Origin], formatted as "Made in X" or "Imported" if unknown  
Category: [Item Category]  
Care Instructions: [Special Care Instructions] or skip if none available  

Use correct punctuation and capitalization, reuse the same terms and format to describe details as well. E.g. a 5 pocket construction, zipper closure, cuffed hem, surgeon cuff, 3 button closure. 

### Use GPT to generate tags with the following prompt: 

Create 10 Grailed-appropriate tags for:
[Designer]: {Designer}
[Category]: {Category}
[Style]: {Design Details}
[Material]: {Primary Material}
[Era]: {Season/Year}

Format as comma-separated list. Include designer name, style, materials, era/year if vintage, and relevant fashion movements/aesthetics.
